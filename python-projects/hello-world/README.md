# Hello World Program

This is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It serves as an introductory example for learning Python programming.

## Features

- Prints a greeting message: `"Hello, World!"`

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

Output:
```
Hello, World!
```

## How It Works

The program defines a `main` function that contains a single `print` statement. When the script is executed, the `main` function is called.

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program is a classic example used to introduce the basics of Python programming.
