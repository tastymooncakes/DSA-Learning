# DSA Learning Projects

This repository is dedicated to learning Python programming and mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains a collection of projects, scripts, and notes designed to build foundational skills and solve algorithmic problems.

## Objectives

- **Learn Python**: Gain proficiency in Python programming through hands-on projects and examples.
- **Master DSA**: Understand and implement key data structures and algorithms to solve computational problems efficiently.

## Projects Overview

### Hello World

A simple introductory script to get started with Python. It prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

**File:** `python-projects/hello-world/main.py`

### Calculator

A command-line calculator that demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, including argument parsing and arithmetic operations.

**File:** `python-projects/calculator/main.py`

#### Features:
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles edge cases like division by zero.

#### Example Usage:
```bash
python main.py + 5 3
```

Output:
```
Result: 8.0
```

## Notes

This repository also includes notes on Python programming and Data Structures and Algorithms. These notes provide theoretical explanations, examples, and best practices to complement the hands-on projects.

More projects, examples, and notes will be added as the learning journey progresses.
